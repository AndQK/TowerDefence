MEETING MONDAY 15.11.2022:

Present: all members 

The last work week has been quite short, since the project plan was due last friday and during the weekend we did not have a lot of time. During the short period of time Samuli created the coordinate and map classes. He also created the test class and added his own tests into it. Samuli was also a huge help in setting up the environment and helping others do the same. Viivi created the player and main classes. She also made a new function into the test class to test her player class and was the secretary at the group meeting. Antonio started to familiarized himself with qt and Edris started to plan the graphic designing.

We found a problem of pushing into git and messing up others classes and such. So then we had to try to take out commits and this was very hard. Our solution to this problem is for everyone to push to their own branches and merging to the main branch later. This henze minimizes problems like editing same files at the same time and such.

Plan for this week for everyone is to get fully started on the project according to the project plan. To our knowledge everyone takes part on the meeting with our supervisor this week. In addition everyone has their own tasks to complete. Samuli will begin with the game class and get it going. Viivi will try to finish the enemies class and test it, making sure it works. Edris will work on the level class and the graphic designing. Antonio will try to get the GUI to work to some extent.

We have not yet deviated from the project plan. After getting feedback from our supervisor there could be some modifications.
