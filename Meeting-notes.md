MEETING TUESDAY 15.11.2022:

Present: all members 

The last work week has been quite short, since the project plan was due last friday and during the weekend we did not have a lot of time. During the short period of time Samuli created the coordinate and map classes. He also created the test class and added his own tests into it. Samuli was also a huge help in setting up the environment and helping others do the same. Viivi created the player and main classes. She also made a new function into the test class to test her player class and was the secretary at the group meeting. Antonio started to familiarized himself with qt and Edris started to plan the graphic designing.

We found a problem of pushing into git and messing up others classes and such. So then we had to try to take out commits and this was very hard. Our solution to this problem is for everyone to push to their own branches and merging to the main branch later. This henze minimizes problems like editing same files at the same time and such.

Plan for this week for everyone is to get fully started on the project according to the project plan. To our knowledge everyone takes part on the meeting with our supervisor this week. In addition everyone has their own tasks to complete. Samuli will begin with the game class and get it going. Viivi will try to finish the enemies class and test it, making sure it works. Edris will work on the level class and the graphic designing. Antonio will try to get the GUI to work to some extent.

We have not yet deviated from the project plan. After getting feedback from our supervisor there could be some modifications.


MEETING WEDNESDAY 23.11.2022:

Present: all members

This was the first full working week on the project and we got the project well on the way. Samuli added the SMFL libraries to the main application. Modified the Enemy class so that enemies can move on the map. He also made the Projectile class and the recognition of collisions of enemies and projectiles. Related to this he updated the test class for projectiles and simple GUI. In general Samuli also helped other group members a lot. Antonio made a test which tests drawing of textures and sprites, how enemies move on map paths and generating paths. In addition preliminary planning for the inside functions for the GUI were made. Viivi did not have a lot of time this week due to work rush, but she did complete everything that was set for her to do this week. She completed the abstract class Enemy and it's enemies HardEnemy, EasyEnemy and SplittingEnemy. Like everyone else she created her own tests for these to make sure they worked as intended. She also held the meeting again and wrote up the notes. Edris has made three graphical maps in PNG format. He also has implemented enemies and towers graphically. He has also been making the level class and tested it.

We had some problems with git since we aren't very familiar with pushing and pulling from the main branch to our own yet. But with google and some helping hands we were able to pass this obstacle and find a working way to do this.

Next week Samuli will mostly be connecting the GUI and Game class to other class to get the classes to work together and bring the game together. Antonio will continue working on the GUI. He will begin building the GUI class which is how we can connect the Game class to it. Viivi will work on the abstract class tower and the towers that belong to it next week. Edris will plan what the game menu will look like and what kind of effects will happen when someone looses the game. He will also plan some sound effects.

A big deviation to our plan is that we decided to switch from qt to smfl, since the use of qt made it more difficult to progress with our project.


MEETING THURSDAY 1.12.2022:

Present: Ando, Samuli, Viivi

Edris is in the US so a meeting time suitable for everyone was not possible.

This was the week that we were supposed to get most of the aspects of the game done, but they took longer than expected. Also everyone was very busy with other school work and studying for exams since it is the last week of school before exam week. Edris was able to design the game menu picture and implement it. Viivi did the abstract class Tower and its subclasses SlowingTower, BasicTower and BombTower. She also started to work on the towers hitting the enemies with projectiles. Samuli did a lot of work last week so that he could do a little less this week. Samuli has worked with projectiles and thought about how hitting enemies could work. He has also been helping everyone with their parts. Antonio has worked on GUI functions, as in tested how the players inputs work. He has also worked on the panel that the player will eventually play with. 

Our biggest problem has been the strict schedule for the project and having time to implement it. 

Next week and the week after that project demos are coming up and the final commit has to be done already next Friday. Viivi will finish hitting the enemies with projectiles. Ando will finish the GUI. Samuli will help others in their parts and finalize the game. During the following week Edris will try to get the sound effects to work.
